- **Market TAM (total addressable market) validation (El Salvador, private-sector factoring):** 47,788 formal MSMEs (BCR 2024 dataset: 34,710 micro, 9,881 small, 3,197 medium). Applying average revenues ($60K / $600K / $3.5M) and a 15% receivables factor yields $2,880.1M of outstanding invoices; subtracting $141.0M B2G (business-to-government) exposure (12% PAC 2023 × MIPYME quota) leaves $2,739.1M TAM net. With ~60-day rotation (~6x annually) and 75% eligibility, annualized TAM is ~$12,470M of financeable private-sector invoices.
