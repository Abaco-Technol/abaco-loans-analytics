# Contributing

## Creating a PR
1. **Squash on merge**: Use squash-and-merge so the main branch history stays clean. Multiple logical commits are fine during development; the final merge will be squashed.
2. **Quality gates**: Run lint/tests and ensure CI (SonarCloud, CodeQL, web/analytics pipelines) is green before requesting review.
3. **Ownership**: Assign yourself, request required reviewers (@codex, @sourcery, @coderabbit, @sonarqube, @gemini, @zencoder), and respond to bot feedback.
4. **Traceability**: Keep changes scoped, with clear commit messages and links to issues or specs.
