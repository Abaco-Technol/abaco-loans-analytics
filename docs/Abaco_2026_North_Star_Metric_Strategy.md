# 🧭 Abaco 2026 — North Star Metric Strategy (NSM)

## Executive summary
- **Goal:** Align the organization around a single metric that reflects sustainable value creation for the B2B factoring business.
- **North Star Metric:** **Weekly/Monthly Recurrent TPV from Active Clients** (processed volume from clients that repeat within the period).
- **Why it matters:** Captures retention, expansion, and portfolio health while tying directly to revenue, risk, and governance guardrails (rotation ≥4.5×, default/NPL <4%, Top-10 concentration ≤30%, single-obligor ≤4%).

## Context and strategic theses
- **Target market:** Formal SMEs using accounts receivable for liquidity; e-invoicing adoption eases origination and monitoring.
- **Edge:** Debtor-centric risk engine and pricing segmented by CreditLineCategory (A–H).
- **Shift:** Move beyond one-time origination to recurrent platform usage and quality of collections.

## Value engine and indicators
| Stage | SME action | Value to Abaco | Related metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition | Onboarding and first operation | New clients | New logos by segment |
| Engagement | Recurrent factoring usage | Recurrent TPV | **NSM:** Weekly/Monthly Recurrent TPV |
| Conversion | Invoice financing | Revenue and margin | % invoices financed, weighted APR |
| Retention/Expansion | Credit-line upsell | Higher LTV | TPV per recurrent client, bucket upgrades |
| Portfolio health | Collections and cures | Controlled risk | Default rate, DPD/NPL, debtor concentration |

## Calculation and governance
- **Definition:** TPV generated by clients with at least two funded invoices in the last 8 weeks (weekly) or 3 months (monthly).
- **Filters:** Exclude one-off invoices, clawbacks, or charge-offs; enforce debtor and obligor limits; drop invoices with missing debtor tax ID or KYC flags.
- **Data quality:** Require completeness >95% on invoice amount, debtor, due date, and collection status; block release when quality falls below 90%.

## Operating cadence
- **Dashboards:** Daily refresh for ops; weekly executive pack with NSM trend, cohort views, and variance to plan.
- **Actions:** Trigger playbooks for TPV drops by channel, debtor concentration breaches, or DPD/NPL drift; align product/credit with guardrails.
